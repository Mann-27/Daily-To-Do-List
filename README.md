#Daily-To-Do-List
The Todo-list web application allows users to efficiently manage tasks through simple CRUD operations directly in their browser using local storage. It provides a seamless and responsive user experience without the need for a database. This tool is perfect for staying organized and on top of daily tasks.



The Todo-list web application is a straightforward yet highly functional project that I've developed, incorporating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and local storage functionality. 
This is my first web development project which I developed through self learning and hands-on-practise on javascript and responsive web design.
Learned basics of git through this project.
